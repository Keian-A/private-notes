# What is a Tree?

A tree is a data structure what contains N nodes, all having exactly 1 parent node.

In a tree, we can expect a specific tree data structure of N nodes to contain exactly (N-1) branches, or edges.

All nodes must be accessible from the [root](./Root.md).

###### Fun Fact: Technically, in computer science, all trees are a type of graph. However, not all graphs can be a type of tree.

There are different types of trees:

- [Binary Search Tree](./BST/BST.md)
- [K-ary Tree](./K-ary/K-ary.md)
