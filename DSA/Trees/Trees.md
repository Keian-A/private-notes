# What is a Tree?

A tree is a data structure what contains N nodes, all having exactly 1 parent node.

In a tree, we can expect a specific tree data structure of N nodes to contain exactly (N-1) edges.

All nodes must be accessible from the "root."

Technically, in computer science, all trees are a type of graph. However, not all graphs can be a type of tree.

There are different types of trees, which can determine the amount of *children* that any idividual parent node can have, as well as a type of tree that can be sorted dynamically as values are added.

- Binary Search Tree
- K-ary Tree
