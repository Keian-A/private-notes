# Basic Docker Commands

This command will display a current list of running containers with Docker.
> `docker ps`

Add the -a modifier to see even stopped containers.
> `docker ps -a`

To run an interactable container, run:
> `docker run -it [image_name]`

The -it modifier stands for interactive.

After running this command you will see something like:
> `root@12j3b2bl1jk2: /#`
- root: represents the currently logged in user. By default this is root, which has highest-level privileges.
- after @: the name of the machine. In this case: `12j3b2bl1jk2`. This is automatically generated by docker.
- after ':' the / means you are in the top level directory.
- the # means you have the highest level privileges.
- If you weren't signed in as root user, you should see '$' instead of '#'.
