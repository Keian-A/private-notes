# What is Breadth First Search (BFS)?

### This is an algorithm for searching a [graph](../Graph/Graph.md) or [tree](../Trees/Trees.md).

- Breadth = broad || wide

In other words, our algorithm will progress horizontally. In breadth first search, nodes are travered by their level on the tree, starting from the root, through the bottom - or leaves.

``` js
// Given that Tree is a variable which represents a tree DS

```
